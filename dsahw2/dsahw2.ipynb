    "#### Question 1: Flask App Extension – Circle Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "The main task in this problem set is to create an extension for the calculator Flask app from Lab 3. In addition to the basic calculator that we created in the lab, this extension should have a page on which a user can calculate the perimeter of a circle by inputting the radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculation of the radius, you should create a `Circle` class, with one method to calculate the perimeter and one method to calculate the area of the circle. You should write one unit test for each of these methods. To make this task easier, start by cloning this repository to begin with a working version of the calculator app from the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit your code as a Pull Request to this repository. We will then check whether your code runs correctly and whether your tests do what they are supposed to. Please provide a link to the Pull Request in the document you submit on Moodle (along with your answers to questions 2 and 3). For full marks, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) (3 points):** Write the `Circle` class (with the perimeter and area methods) in a separate Python module (like `helper.py`, in the repository) called `circle.py` and import it into the main Flask module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) (3 points):** Create a template similar to the `calculator.html` template, with an HTML form in which the user can input the radius, and render this template from the main module.\n",
